title:  About
---

I'm a Software Engineer by trade and a [Physicist](http://physics.tau.ac.il/)-[Economist](http://econ.tau.ac.il/) by education, from Tel Aviv, Israel. I'm passionate about system architecture, scalability and highly available distributed systems.

I've been mainly obsessed with [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) for the past three years. I've also drank the [TDD](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) kool-aid and am now putting a lot of my effort/thought into [end-to-end testing](/2014/09/24/true-end-to-end-testing-in-scala-scalapeno-2014-talk/).

I work at <del>[DVTel](http://www.dvtel.com)</del>  <del>[Zemingo](http://zemingo.com)</del>  [Wix](http://wix.com) on backend services, powering Wix.com and our various applications. I mainly code in <del>C#</del> <del>PHP</del> <del>JavaScript</del> <del>HTML/CSS/SASS</del> Scala and Java. I also like to dabble with <del>Chef</del>, <del>Puppet</del>, Ansible, <del>Vagrant</del>, and Docker, to name a few.

Previously founded <del>[Ginipic](http://ginipic.com)</del> and <del>[SpiderPic](http://spiderpic.com)</del> (the former sold to [MessengerPlus!](http://www.msgplus.net/)). I make [open source](https://github.com/orrsella) software, mostly for Scala and [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org).

## This Site

In case you're wondering, this site is running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) – a simple and lightweight static site generator – being served by [nginx](http://nginx.org/), and is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4221a39d182a). All posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can check out the Jekyll sources [here](https://github.com/orrsella/orrsella.com). I use [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) to manage the server, and you can see how I do that [here](https://github.com/orrsella/mah-server).

You can subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/rss.xml), if you like.
