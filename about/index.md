title:  About
---

I'm a Software Engineer by trade and a [Physicist](https://physics.tau.ac.il/)-[Economist](https://en-econ.tau.ac.il/) by education, from Tel Aviv, Israel. I'm passionate about system architecture, scalability and highly available distributed systems. Interested in RPC frameworks, cluster schedulers, and build/deployment tools.

I've been mainly obsessed with [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) for the past few years. I've also drank the [TDD](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) kool-aid and have put a lot of effort into [end-to-end testing](/2014/09/24/true-end-to-end-testing-in-scala-scalapeno-2014-talk/). More recently I've been putting a lot of thought into [build](/2015/05/31/getting-started-with-pants-build-for-scala-projects/) [tools](https://github.com/orrsella/bazel-example) and [deployment](https://github.com/orrsella/ansible-mesos).

I work at <del>[DVTel](http://www.dvtel.com)</del> <del>[Zemingo](http://www.zemingo.com)</del> <del>[Wix](http://www.wix.com)</del> [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and mainly code in <del>C#</del> <del>PHP</del> <del>JavaScript</del> <del>HTML/CSS/SASS</del> <del>Scala and</del> Java.

Previously founded <del>[Ginipic](http://ginipic.com)</del> and <del>[SpiderPic](http://spiderpic.com)</del> (the former sold to [Messenger Plus!](http://www.msgplus.net/)). I make [open source](https://github.com/orrsella) software, mostly for Scala and [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org).
