I'm a Software Engineer by trade and a [Physicist](http://physics.tau.ac.il/)-[Economist](http://econ.tau.ac.il/) by education, from Tel Aviv, Israel. I'm passionate about system architecture, scalability and highly available distributed systems. I've been mainly obsessed with [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) for the past couple of years.

I work at <del>[DVTel](http://www.dvtel.com)</del>  <del>[Zemingo](http://zemingo.com)</del>  [Wix](http://wix.com) on backend services, powering Wix.com and our various applications. I mainly code in <del>C#</del> <del>PHP</del> <del>JavaScript</del> <del>HTML/CSS</del> Scala and Java. I also like to dabble with <del>Chef</del>, <del>Puppet</del>, Ansible, <del>Vagrant</del>, Docker, <del>Less</del> and Sass, to name a few.

Previously founded <del>[Ginipic](http://ginipic.com)</del> and <del>[SpiderPic](http://spiderpic.com)</del> (the former sold to [MessengerPlus!](http://www.msgplus.net/)). I make [open source](http://github.com/orrsella) software, mostly for Scala and [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org).

## This Site

In case you're wondering, this site is running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) – a simple and lightweight static site generator – being served by [nginx](http://nginx.org/), and is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4221a39d182a) (that's an affiliate link). It's based on the "[minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)" theme by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). All posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) – the *best* way to write anything that's not code, as far as I'm concerned. You can check out the Jekyll sources [here](https://github.com/orrsella/orrsella.com). I use [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) to manage the server, and you can see how I do that [here](https://github.com/orrsella/mah-server).

You can subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/rss.xml), if you like.
