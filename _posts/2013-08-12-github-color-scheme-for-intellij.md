title:  GitHub Color Scheme for IntelliJ
---

I love [GitHub](https://github.com/orrsella). I use it to manage all my personal projects (see my [post on multiple users](/2013/08/10/git-using-different-user-emails-for-different-repositories/) with Git), as well as for browsing other libraries. I like it so much that I even sometimes prefer using it for browsing source code that's locally on my machine.

Because I use it so much, I've grown accustomed to it's color scheme, especially for Scala and Java. I tried to find a color scheme for IntelliJ that uses those colors with GitHub's style, but couldn't find one. That's why I created the [intellij-github-scheme](https://github.com/orrsella/intellij-github-scheme). Check it out if you like GitHub's colors. Also, if you choose to use it and find any errors/add support for other languages or syntax, I'd love to get [pull requests](https://github.com/orrsella/intellij-github-scheme/pulls) from you.

You can see it in "action" here (for [tumblr4s](https://github.com/orrsella/tumblr4s)):
