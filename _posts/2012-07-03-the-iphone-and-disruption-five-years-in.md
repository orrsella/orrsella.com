title:  "The iPhone and Disruption: Five Years In"

[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/iphone_disruption_five_years_in):

> I wonder how many people would have formed a different, more accurate, perception of the iPhone and its implications for the future if Apple hadn’t put “phone” in the name. Ken Segall recently revealed that one of the first names Apple considered for the iPhone was “iPad”, which, if you think about it, is actually a more apt name for the thing. The iPhone is not a phone with other secondary features. It’s a general purpose pocket-sized touchscreen computer, that happens to include cellular phone networking as a feature.

Quote is from the footnote, but just as interesting as the entire piece (if not more).
