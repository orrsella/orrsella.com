![$AAPL]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/aapl.jpg)

Snapped this level II view earlier today, just as the [stock](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL) touched the $600.00 mark and quickly pulled back to around $599.20 – check out that huge selling pressure (numbers are in thousands...)!

Someone really wants to dump 370,000 + 356,000 + 202,000 + 119,000 + 29,000 &#8776; 1.1M AAPL shares at this price. For comparison, average daily volume over the last 30 trading days is 14.76M. This is obviously an interesting price point for the stock, but probably mostly for psychological reasons. It hasn’t been above it since late April.

Going to be interesting to watch it over the next couple of weeks, especially since earnings are [just around the corner](http://investor.apple.com).
