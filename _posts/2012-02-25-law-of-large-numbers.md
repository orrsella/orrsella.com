title: Law of Large Numbers

Many valid and interesting historical and technical arguments, but unfortunately it takes [James Stewart](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/business/apple-confronts-the-law-of-large-numbers-common-sense.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) 19 paragraphs (out of 21) to get to the heart of things (emphasis mine):

> Global mobile phone subscriptions neared six billion in 2011, with **Apple’s share of the handset market at 5.6 percent**, according to the market intelligence firm IDC. “There’s no mathematical reason Apple can’t keep growing at a premium rate for at least several more years,” Mr. Cihra said. “At the end of the day, there’s no good reason for market cap to be a ceiling.”

Everything else is considered “gossip” IMHO. It doesn’t matter what the company’s market cap is – that’s for tech blogs’ headlines. All that matters is that Apple is able to produce such blow-out numbers while only having a 5.6% share of the mobile handset market.
