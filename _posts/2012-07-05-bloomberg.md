It drives me nuts that some publications constantly spell iDevices with a capital I in their story titles. Does [this](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-03/here-comes-nexus-7-nightmare-the-ipad-mini.html) not seem wrong to anyone at Bloomberg? And it’s not like it’s a first, [they](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/apple-pays-60-million-to-end-china-ipad-dispute-with-proview.html) [keep](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-14/court-delays-apple-china-ipad-trademark-ruling-for-talks.html) [doing](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-28/australian-online-shopping-slows-on-greece-ipad-lull.html) [it](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-19/microsoft-unveils-surface-tablet-computer-taking-on-ipad-1-.html) [all](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-19/ipad-boom-strains-lithium-supplies-after-prices-triple.html) [the](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-14/apple-ipad-demand-boosts-tablet-shipment-forecast-idc-reports.html) [time](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-07/proview-sees-big-gap-after-apple-offers-to-settle-ipad-dispute.html)!

Now, this would have been half acceptable IMO if this was the their formal “editorial formatting guidelines” (I’m not sure what the correct publishing term for this kind of thing is). Sort of like the New York Times always prints full names when they first appear in an article (referring to Steve Jobs as “Steven P. Jobs” and “Mr. Jobs” from there on out for example), or capitalizing “World Wide Web” and “Web”. I don’t like it, but at least it’s consistent.

But no! Bloomberg sometimes [spells iPad correctly](http://www.bloomberg.com/article/2012-06-28/auIvv_j3lP18.html), and [other times](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-18/oprah-aids-doctors-as-app-investments-soar-health.html) even as Ipad!

And don’t even get me started on how some publications write DropBox or FaceBook. What a bunch of amateurs. God is in the little details.
