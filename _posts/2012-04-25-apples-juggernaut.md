title:  Apple's Juggernaut

[Mind boggling](http://seekingalpha.com/article/524191-apples-juggernaut):

> Each device sold – whether an iPad or the lowly Shuffle – on average earned Apple $263 before taxes. To put that in [perspective](http://seekingalpha.com/article/501271-nokia-s-desperation): Nokia ([NOK](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nok)) made $3 per unit while Research in Motion ([RIMM](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rimm)) made $57 per unit last quarter reported.
