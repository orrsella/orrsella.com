title:  "“Maps have become a hygiene factor for a platform”"
---

[Horace Dediu](http://www.asymco.com/2012/12/18/how-much-to-maps-cost-and-what-are-they-worth):

> Maps have become a hygiene factor for a platform. Not having them makes a platform repulsive but having them offers no attraction.

Great analysis of the “maps business” by [asymco](http://www.asymco.com/2012/12/18/how-much-to-maps-cost-and-what-are-they-worth). Bottom line – nobody wants to be in this business but everybody needs to.
