title: "PHP: A Fractal Of Bad Design"
---

Dear PHP, you’re dead to me. Thanks for a lousy time.

Wow, [this just nails it](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design). Reading this makes everything you always felt while coding in PHP so much more clear. Written beautifully. A must read for every developer (especially PHP ones).

A small spoiler:

* PHP is full of surprises: mysql_real_escape_string, E_ALL
* PHP is inconsistent: strpos, str_rot13
* PHP requires boilerplate: error-checking around C API calls, ===
* PHP is flaky: ==, foreach ($foo as &$bar)
* PHP is opaque: no stack traces by default or for fatals, complex error reporting

I urge you – [read the whole thing](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design). There are so many gems in there. Thank you [@eevee](http://twitter.com/eevee)!

Also, a while back I felt I had to reduce my PHP dosage in order to have fun coding again, which is why I got into Scala:

<div style="width: 500px; margin: auto;">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Just finished chapter 21 in Programming in Scala 2nd Ed: "Implicit Conversions and Parameters", and this language keeps blowing my mind away</p>&mdash; Orr Sella (@orrsella) <a href="https://twitter.com/orrsella/status/206046022160490496">May 25, 2012</a></blockquote>
  <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

And I’m loving every minute of it.
