title:  Should All Web Traffic Be Encrypted?
---

Interesting thoughts by [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/02/should-all-web-traffic-be-encrypted.html).

Also, these Gmail stats:

> In January this year (2010), Gmail switched to using HTTPS for everything by default. Previously it had been introduced as an option, but now all of our users use HTTPS to secure their email between their browsers and Google, all the time. In order to do this we had to deploy no additional machines and no special hardware. On our production frontend machines, SSL/TLS accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load, less than 10KB of memory per connection and less than 2% of network overhead. Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to dispel that.
