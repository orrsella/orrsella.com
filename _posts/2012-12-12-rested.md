![RESTed Update]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/rested.png)

Love this geeky update description for [RESTed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rested-simple-http-requests/id421879749?mt=12).

If you’re not familiar with it, RESTed is a great little app for testing APIs – allows setting custom headers, parameters, encoding, etc. You can save a template of each request after customizing, making it really easy to continuously test endpoints you’re writing, or just for exploring a new API.

Thanks [Hello, Resolven](http://www.helloresolven.com/) for a great app!
