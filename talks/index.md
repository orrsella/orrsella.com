## True End-to-End Testing in Scala
<p class="post-date">September 22, 2014</p>

The [video recording](https://www.parleys.com/play/5460c793e4b0dab81f955667) can be found on Parleys.

In this talk we will show how we can take our unit/integration tests a step further, and see how to test our applications end-to-end. Scala is a prime candidate for end-to-end testing, having all the right pieces in place: an easily extendable build tool (SBT), fluent DSL testing libraries (Specs2/ScalaTest), and the power/tooling of the JVM behind it.

We will see how to approach testing our application from the outside, and touch on concepts such as: the Test Harness, abstracting our SUT (System Under Test) by using test Drivers, using Simplicators for testing against external dependencies, and more. We will put everything together by using tools such as: SBT, Ansible and Vagrant.
